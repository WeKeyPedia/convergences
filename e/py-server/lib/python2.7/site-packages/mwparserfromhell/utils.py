    """Return a :py:class:`~.Wikicode` for *value*, allowing multiple types.

    This differs from :py:meth:`.Parser.parse` in that we accept more than just
    a string to be parsed. Unicode objects (strings in py3k), strings (bytes in
    py3k), integers (converted to strings), ``None``, existing
    :py:class:`~.Node` or :py:class:`~.Wikicode` objects, as well as an
    iterable of these types, are supported. This is used to parse input
    on-the-fly by various methods of :py:class:`~.Wikicode` and others like
    :py:class:`~.Template`, such as :py:meth:`wikicode.insert()
    <.Wikicode.insert>` or setting :py:meth:`template.name <.Template.name>`.

    If given, *context* will be passed as a starting context to the parser.
    This is helpful when this function is used inside node attribute setters.
    For example, :py:class:`~.ExternalLink`\ 's :py:attr:`~.ExternalLink.url`
    setter sets *context* to :py:mod:`contexts.EXT_LINK_URI <.contexts>` to
    prevent the URL itself from becoming an :py:class:`~.ExternalLink`.
